Prerequisites:
    to start application, it is necessary to have Python 2.7 in path.
    Your python have to have sqlite3 installed. If it have not, you can install it with this command python pip install sqlite3.
    (For that, it is also necessary to have pip installed in your python. If you have not, download the script get-pip
    via the script at this link https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and execute it).

    This application has been developed on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 2.7.12.
    It should work on all os with Python 2.7. With others versions of Pythons, the comportment will be undefined.



Start applications:
    To start application, open a console, go to the folder containing the project.
    Go to src folder and run this command "python main.py -dataFilePath 'path to the data base file'"

    The path is obligatory and have to be right. Otherwise, the application won't start.

    All the actions have to be entered in the console with the keyboard (no hui have been developed).
    Follow instructions displayed in the console in order to know what to do or which info to enter.


Implementation:
    The implementation chosen is the following.
    The database elements (Film, People, Vehicle, StarShip, Specie, Planet) are represented by a class.

    The management of the data base is done via a class used as a api (DataBaseManager).
    The request are built in classes before to be retrieved by this api and executed (RequestBuilder).

    The class Application has the role of the controller.
    Some comments in the code precise the role of each theses classes.
